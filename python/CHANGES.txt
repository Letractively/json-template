JSON Template is usually released at:
http://code.google.com/p/json-template/downloads/list

This is the first PyPI release in 2+ years as I am not a PyPI user myself
(sorry).  Lots of changes since the last PyPI release:

- template styles
- section "pre-formatters"
- various tweaks and additions to the set of builtin formatters
- multiline comment
- whitespace options

doc/Design.txt has some skeletal notes.
