Java version

Tested on OSX with Apple's Java 1.6.0_07 and 1.5.0_16.

(Perhaps needlessly) uses Java 5 features (generics, ConcurrentHashMap).

No external dependencies, but the test interface (jsontemplate_test.jar) uses
json.org's JSON library (included).

Currently uses a Makefile to build. Ant script contributions welcome.
